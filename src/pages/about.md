# About Me

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm ***Thomas K. Pham***, a *Senior Cloud Platform Engineer* based in the picturesque town of Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland.

  Since the early stage of this startup company, I played a pivotal role as a Senior DevOps Engineer to scale up its cloud infrastructure and the IT operations, advocating for a DevOps culture with the developer community and usage of state-of-the-art cloud and container technologies.

## Beyond the Keyboard

When I'm not immersed in cloud architectures, I indulge in a variety of hobbies that keep my life balanced and exciting:

- **Skiing and Snowboarding**:  
  Growing up amidst the Swiss Alps, I developed a passion for skiing and snowboarding, even competing in local competitions.

- **Paragliding Adventures**:  
  I once pursued a paragliding license until an unexpected encounter with a pine tree (yes, I literally fell into a sapin!) grounded my aerial aspirations.

- **Electronics and Home Automation**:  
  I'm an avid tinkerer, often found soldering circuits and hacking together home automation systems to make everyday life a bit smarter.

- **Science Enthusiast**:  
  A perpetual student of the sciences, I love exploring new concepts and staying updated with the latest technological advancements.
